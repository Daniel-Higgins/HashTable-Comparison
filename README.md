# HashTable-Comparison
This java application compares Businesses based on reviews (word frequency in hash tables), checks to make sure a business exists with a Btree, and finds the shortest path from one business (node) to the nearest cluster head. First, the application reads businesses and reviews from JSON files from YELP and creates objects based on business id. Each business has its own hashtable that will be compared to every other business hashtable created and finds the closest similar business to the business typed in from the user. A Btree is used to make sure a given business exists. The hashcode for every business is stored into the Btree of integers as well as written to a file with all the data/attributes for that business. Finally, within every business is a cluster head (business). Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path from a given business to the nearest cluster head, stepping through all the nodes ahead.
